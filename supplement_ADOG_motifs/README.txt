Run make_fasta to get fasta of annotated sequences
get_region_sequence_ADOGS.ipynb will generate fastas upstream of ADOGS
get_region_random_intergenic_sequence.ipynb will get random intergenic regions for background for homer

run_homer_motifs.sh runs homer

OUT/HS_combined_ADOG_Annotated_sequences_HS_500_findmotif_OUT has all of the html outputs

in Positive_control_HS_genes get_gene.ipynb will get fastas upstream from hsf-1 activated genes (left venn in brunquel_hs_venn.xlsx supplemental). Out file has all html's from homer output
